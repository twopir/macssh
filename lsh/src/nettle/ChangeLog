2001-09-02  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* twofish.c (twofish_decrypt): Fixed for();-bug in the block-loop.
	Spotted by Jean-Pierre.
	(twofish_encrypt): Likewise.

2001-07-03  Niels Möller  <nisse@ehand.com>

	* testsuite/testutils.c: Include string.h.

	* twofish.c: Include string.h.

2001-06-17  Niels Möller  <nisse@lysator.liu.se>

	* Makefile.am (des_headers): Dont use $(srcdir)/-prefixes as that
	seems to break with GNU make 3.79.1.

	* testsuite/testutils.c, testsuite/testutils.h: Use <inttypes.h>,
	not <stdint.h>.
	Include <stdlib.h>.

2001-06-17  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* Use <inttypes.h>, not <stdint.h>.

	* blowfish.h (BLOWFISH_MAX_KEY_SIZE): Fixed, should be 56. 

	* Fixed copyright notices.

	* Makefile.am (libnettle_a_SOURCES): Added desinfo.h and
	desCode.h. 
	(info_TEXINFOS): Added manual.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added nettle.html.
	(%.html): Added rule for building nettle.html.

	* nettle.texinfo: New manual.

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 0.2.

	* testsuite/Makefile.am (TS_PROGS): Added cast128 test.

	* Added CAST128.

	* testsuite/serpent-test.m4: Added a few rudimentary tests
	extracted from the serpent package.

	* twofish.c: Adapted to nettle. Made constant tables const.
	Deleted bytes_to_word and word_to_bytes; use LE_READ_UINT32 and
	LE_WRITE_UINT32 instead.
	(twofish_selftest): Deleted. Moved the tests to the external
	testsuite. 
	(twofish_set_key): Don't silently truncate too large keys. 

	* sha1.c (sha1_update): Use unsigned for length.

	* serpent.c (serpent_set_key): Read the key backwards. Fixed
	padding (but there are no test vectors for key_size not a multiple
	of 4).
	(serpent_encrypt): Read and write data in the strange order used
	by the reference implementation.
	(serpent_decrypt): Likewise.

	* macros.h (FOR_BLOCKS): New macro, taken from lsh.

	* blowfish.h (struct blowfish_ctx): Use a two-dimensional array
	for s.

	* blowfish.c (initial_ctx): Arrange constants into a struct, to
	simplify key setup.
	(F): Deleted all but one definitions of the F function/macro.
	Added a context argument, and use that to find the subkeys.
	(R): Added context argument, and use that to find the subkeys.
	(blowfish_set_key): Some simplification.

	(encrypt): Deleted code for non-standard number of rounds. Deleted
	a bunch of local variables. Using the context pointer for
	everything should consume less registers.
	(decrypt): Likewise.

	* Makefile.am (libnettle_a_SOURCES): Added twofish.

2001-06-16  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* testsuite/blowfish-test.m4: Fixed test.

	* Added twofish implementation.

	* blowfish.h (struct blowfish_ctx): Use the correct size for the p
	array. 

2001-06-15  Niels Möller  <nisse@ehand.com>

	* testsuite/blowfish-test.m4: Fixed testcase, use correct key
	length. 

	* Makefile.am (libnettle_a_SOURCES): Added blowfish files.
	($(des_headers)): Strip directory part when passing file name to
	desdata. 

	* testsuite/blowfish-test.m4: Added one test, from GNUPG.

	* Created blowfish.c and blowfish.h (from GNUPG via LSH). Needs
	more work.

	* aes.h: Fixed copyright notice to not mention GNU MP. XXX: Review
	all nettle copyrights.

	* testsuite/Makefile.am (TS_PROGS): Added tests for twofish and
	blowfish.

	successful.
	
	* testsuite/Makefile.am (TS_PROGS): Added tests for des and sha1.

	* testsuite/des-test.m4: New file.

2001-04-17  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* install-sh: Copied the standard install script.

	$(top_srcdir) to the include path.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added testutils.h, testutils.c and run-tests.
	(run-tests): Fixed path to run-tests.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added memxor.h.
