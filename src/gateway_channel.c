/* A pair of gateway_channel objects are chained together so that
 * requests and data received on one of the channels are directed to
 * the other.
 *
 * Chaining happens as follows:
 *
 * 1. First a CHANNEL_OPEN request is received on one connection, and
 *    a channel object is created. We refer to this object as the
 *    _originating_ channel.
 *
 * 2. Next, we send a similar CHANNEL_OPEN request on some other
 *    connection, and create a channel object referred to as the
 *    _target_ channel.
 *
 * 3. When we receive a reply to the CHANNEL_OPEN request sent in (2),
 *    we chain the two channel objects together, and reply to the
 *    CHANNEL_OPEN request we received in (1). */
