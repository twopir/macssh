/* FIXME: This code doesn't handle authentication methods where the
 * result (continuation or exception) is not invoked immediately.
 * There are two problems:
 *
 * 1. Requests are not necessarily replied to in order. That is bad,
 * but can probably be fixed fairly easily the same way that it is
 * done for GLOBAL_REQUEST messages.
 *
 * 2. Packets that are received after a sucessful USERAUTH_REQUEST
 * message, but before it is processed and replied to, must somehow be
 * queued until we know that the user is authenticated for some
 * service to receive them.
 *
 * I think the right thing to do is to serialize userauth requests
 * completely: if a request can't be replied to immediately, put the
 * entire connection on hold until the reply is ready.
 *
 * This code now uses serialization, using connection_lock and
 * connection_unlock. However, the implementation of serialization
 * is rather stupid. And will crash if a userauth method returns to
 * the main loop while the connection is still locked. */
